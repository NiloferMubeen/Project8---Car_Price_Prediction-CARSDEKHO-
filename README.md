# CARDEKHO Used Car Price Prediction
The main objective of this project is to build a data science model to accuratelt predict the used car prices by analyzing the features like model, age of car, kms_driven, mileage, engine displacement etc.
# Tools Used
1. Python
2. Pandas, Numpy
3. Matplotlit, Seaborn
4. Power BI
5. Scikit learn (Regression Algorithms, Label Encoder)
6. Streamlit
# Data Preprocessing
* The data collected from the cardekho website in the form of dictionaries is preprocessed and the relevant features were collected from the data set.
* The dataset was checked for nulls and duplicates. The duplicates were dropped and null values were replaced with the correct values by analysing the dataset.
* Features like mileage, engine displacement, kms driven were formatted to numercial columns
# Exploratory Data Analysis 
* Visualizations using Matplotlib and Seaborn were used to further understand the data and some insights were derived
* The following Power BI dashboards were built for EDA
